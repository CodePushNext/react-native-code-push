## Android Setup

* [Plugin Installation and Configuration for React Native 0.76 version and above](#plugin-installation-and-configuration-for-react-native-060-version-and-above-android)
* [Code Signing setup](#code-signing-setup)

In order to integrate CodePush into your Android project, please perform the following steps:

### Plugin Installation and Configuration for React Native 0.76 version and above (Android)


1. In your `android/app/build.gradle` file, add the `codepush.gradle` file as an additional build task definition to the end of the file:

    ```gradle
    ...
    apply from: "../../node_modules/@code-push-next/react-native-code-push/android/codepush.gradle"
    ...
    ```

2. Update the `MainApplication` file to use CodePush via the following changes:

    For React Native 0.76 and above: update the `MainApplication.kt`

    **Important! : PackageList must be instantiated only one in application lifetime.** 

    ```kotlin
    ...
    // 1. Import the plugin class.
    import com.microsoft.codepush.react.CodePush

    class MainApplication : Application(), ReactApplication {
   
    // PackageList must be instantiated only one in application lifetime.
    val defaultPackageList by lazy { 
      PackageList(this).packages.apply {
        // Packages that cannot be autolinked yet can be added manually here, for example:
        // add(MyReactNativePackage())
      }
    }

    override val reactNativeHost: ReactNativeHost =
        object : DefaultReactNativeHost(this) {
            ...

            // 2. Override the getJSBundleFile method in order to let
            // the CodePush runtime determine where to get the JS
            // bundle location from on each app start
            override fun getJSBundleFile(): String {
                return CodePush.getJSBundleFile() 
            }
        };
    }
    ```


3. Add the Deployment key to `strings.xml`:

   To let the CodePush runtime know which deployment it should query for updates, open your app's `strings.xml` file and add a new string named `CodePushDeploymentKey`, whose value is the key of the deployment you want to configure this app against (like the key for the `Staging` deployment for the `FooBar` app). You can retrieve this value by running `appcenter codepush deployment list -a <ownerName>/<appName> -k` in the CodePush CLI (the `-k` flag is necessary since keys aren't displayed by default) and copying the value of the `Key` column which corresponds to the deployment you want to use (see below). Note that using the deployment's name (like Staging) will not work. The "friendly name" is intended only for authenticated management usage from the CLI, and not for public consumption within your app.

   ![Deployment list](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/116461/11601733/13011d5e-9a8a-11e5-9ce2-b100498ffb34.png)

   In order to effectively make use of the `Staging` and `Production` deployments that were created along with your CodePush app, refer to the [multi-deployment testing](../README.md#multi-deployment-testing) docs below before actually moving your app's usage of CodePush into production.

   Your `strings.xml` should looks like this:

   ```xml
    <resources>
        <string name="app_name">AppName</string>
        <string moduleConfig="true" name="CodePushDeploymentKey">DeploymentKey</string>
    </resources>
    ```

    *Note: If you need to dynamically use a different deployment, you can also override your deployment key in JS code using [Code-Push options](./api-js.md#CodePushOptions)*



#### Background React Instances

*This section is only necessary if you're <b>explicitly</b> launching a React Native instance without an `Activity` (for example, from within a native push notification receiver). For these situations, CodePush must be told how to find your React Native instance.*

In order to update/restart your React Native instance, CodePush must be configured with a `ReactInstanceHolder` before attempting to restart an instance in the background. This is done in your `Application` implementation.

##### For React Native >= v0.29 (Background React Instances)

Update the `MainApplication.java` file to use CodePush via the following changes:

```java
...
// 1. Declare your ReactNativeHost to extend ReactInstanceHolder. ReactInstanceHolder is a subset of ReactNativeHost, so no additional implementation is needed.
import com.microsoft.codepush.react.ReactInstanceHolder;

public class MyReactNativeHost extends ReactNativeHost implements ReactInstanceHolder {
  // ... usual overrides
}

// 2. Provide your ReactNativeHost to CodePush.

public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {

   private final MyReactNativeHost mReactNativeHost = new MyReactNativeHost(this);

   @Override
   public void onCreate() {
     CodePush.setReactInstanceHolder(mReactNativeHost);
     super.onCreate();
  }
}
```

In order to effectively make use of the `Staging` and `Production` deployments that were created along with your CodePush app, refer to the [multi-deployment testing](../README.md#multi-deployment-testing) docs below before actually moving your app's usage of CodePush into production.



### Code Signing setup

Starting with CLI version **2.1.0** you can self sign bundles during release and verify its signature before installation of update. For more info about Code Signing please refer to [relevant code-push documentation section](https://github.com/microsoft/code-push/tree/v3.0.1/cli#code-signing). In order to use Public Key for Code Signing you need to do following steps:

   Add `CodePushPublicKey` string item to `/path_to_your_app/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`. It may looks like this:

 ```xml
 <resources>
    <string name="app_name">my_app</string>
    <string name="CodePushPublicKey">-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAtPSR9lkGzZ4FR0lxF+ZA

-----END PUBLIC KEY-----</string>
</resources>
 ```
